My girlfriend just kept lecturing about how lazy I am. After some times, all I could do is reply her with "OK…" or "OK!" or "OK now" and maybe a combination of those words. We all have been in similar situations. Not the girlfriend situations but the situations where you just reply "OK" for the conversation to get over.

While she was talking, I wondered why am I saying OK this many times, and what does this OK actually mean? What is “OK” and, how and when it came into usage?


“OK” is arguably the most used word and the most recognizable word on the face of modern Earth. 
Communications and linguistics is a whole branch that studies the origin of languages, how we communicate, etc. This field is significantly on the rise, indicating that it is indispensable to study how we communicate with the rapid advancements of technology, making way into our lives. 

We very certainly use it at least once every day. And no, it is not a hasty generalization.

The story of “OK” eventually traces back to the 1830s infatuation of unintentionally misspelling abbreviations. Young so-called "Intellectuals," ones in the US, specifically in Boston, found it best practice with those "In The Know" butchered coded messages. Some examples are KC, which means "Knuff Ced”; KY, meaning “Know Yuse,"; and OW, “oll wright." Just like we use LOL, WTF, LMAO, and others in the present times.

However, although the changes in many breaks and zeitgeists, one abbreviation stood still. It was OK or "oll korrect." Around the early 19th century, “oll korrect” was not an aberrant word that people used to confirm that everything was in place and order. Its abbreviated relative, "all correct" went mainstream on and around March 23, 1839, when OK was actually [first published](https://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/2017/03/23/boston-morning-post-ok/) in the Boston Morning Post. Right after this, other papers caught up on the joke of messed up abbreviations and published it across the country of the US. As time went by, the usage of OK became popular that it no longer was only known by just a few Boston insiders.

An even more fascinating thing about the history of OK was a flailing US president, Martin Van Buren, from Kinderhook, New York, used it as a nickname during his 1840 [re-election campaign](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/business/podcasts/presidential/pdfs/martin-van-buren-transcript.pdf). Van Buren supporters came together to form OK Clubs across the country with the intriguing campaign of a conspicuous [message](https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/50042/whats-real-origin-ok) being  Old Kinderhook was “oll korrect."

However, the bad part was that the campaign was very highly published, which turned pretty nasty in the press. His opponents used the abbreviations as something else, like "Orful Konspracy," "Orful Katastrophe." In the end, even a subtly smart nickname, marketing, did not save Van Buren's presidency.  

Even though it was a loss was Van Buren, it was a win for our beloved OK. This presidential campaign paved the way for OK to get out being used in slang, pushing out other similar abbreviations, and into the mainstream legitimate functional use. This was fuelled by the then-latest invention: the telegraph. 
The telegraph came into the picture in 1844, just after 5 years of OK's mainstream entrance. It transmitted short messages, in the form of electric pulses, with combinations of dots and dashes representing letters of the alphabet. This is where OK shined. The two letters had a simple combination of dots and dashes, which made them easy to tap out and less likely to be confused with anything else. A habit quickly came into the operators of telegraphs. As a standard acknowledgment of transmission received, especially operators on the flourishing US railroad. This practice went on till it became so usual that the telegraphic manual from 1865 even goes as far as to say that "no message is ever as transmitted until the office receiving it gives OK."


OK did not merely become popular in usage just because it is simple to communicate. Another reason as the book "[OK: The Improbable Story Of America’s Greatest Word](https://books.google.co.in/books?hl=en&lr=&id=IWvRCwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PR7&dq=research+articles+on+the+word+%22ok%22&ots=5AEwdunQGe&sig=h7bI2GBY-o_V6asH4nIRMgUnC0U#v=onepage&q&f=false)” says is that there is something to do with how OK looks. Especially how the letter “K” looks and sounds. 

The fascinating thing about it is that it is very uncommon to start a word with the letter “K” in English. Its rank is 22nd in the alphabet. This rarity gave way for the advertising and media company a “Kraze for K” wherein companies replaced tough Cs with Ks in order to catch your eye. Well, in this context, I’d like to say Katch your eye. Visual strategies developed from this idea where we see modern corporate logos being represented with K. For example, Krispy Kreme, which is a big doughnut shop in the US. 
It is the K that makes it memorable to us.  

By the 1890s, the Bostonian origins and traits of OK were already mostly forgotten, and the press media became a platform to debate its history- often perpetuating myths in the process that some people still believe. One of them is that it comes from the word 'Okeh,' meaning 'so it is.'

_This is where I wondered, isn’t it media’s responsibility to put out content before the public and expose them to affairs where they can make informed decisions?_  


However, coming back to the story, OK's birth history had become obscure, but it doesn't really matter to us anymore. The word is just embedded in our languages. Every major language speaking person around the world would understand OK. Can it be based as an example to show how globalized our world is? Well, that's a discussion for later.

Today, we use the word OK as a “neutral affirmative.” Allan Metcalf, the author of the book I earlier mentioned, “OK: The Impossible Story Of America's Greatest Word," solidly mentions the definitive history of OK, and he deliberates that the word "affirms without evaluating." This means that OK doesn't convey any meanings but just acknowledges and accepts the information. 

 If the food was OK, then it was acceptable. If you are OK, then you are most probably in a normal condition. Even though OK has a lot of complications and meanings in the conversations of young couples these days, a simple OK can even change plans. OK is ingrained into our lives that it sort of became a reflex for us. We do not even keep track of how much we use the word.

It is fascinating to me that OK was arguably the first word spoken when humans landed on the moon. Not bad for a corny jocular expression from 1830 to conquer the world, right
