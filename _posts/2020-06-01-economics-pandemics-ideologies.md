Some things to be clear about before I get started. 

**Am I an expert on any of the three topics I mentioned in the heading? **

Read the heading once again. Think of it like Arnab Goswami on Republic TV: engaging on the surface, but empty once you sit down and think about it.

**Ok, so am I merely passionate about the subject?**

As much as I respect the subject and how it addresses several important world issues, I have come to realize that I'm more inclined towards communications and psychology than to economics. 

**Did I at least do some legitimate research on the subject?**

Well, yes, but actually no. If you count discussion threads on Reddit, In-Shorts, and a few (read: few) media outlets here and there, yes, I've been busy. If you're expecting this piece to enlighten you and help you pass your next quiz, you'll be quite disappointed, my friend.

**So, why am I doing this?**

Frankly, I don't know. Lockdown has a way of getting to you in ways you may not be able to explain. 

Dad once told me that everyone's an expert in drawing-room discussions. A genuinely interested individual documents his thoughts, no matter how absurd. I guess I'm following his words in my own messed up way. That's the most feasible explanation I can come up with at present. 

So, what's the point of this article then?

Again, I do not know. This isn't for anyone else as much as it's an outlet for me. Maybe, I've had so much free time to ponder over things, that I've come up with some ideas and theories in my head which I felt should be out there.

Due to lack of adequate research, it is highly probable that each and every one of my thoughts and ideas is already out there as some economic theory/policy that I've not heard of yet or probably slept through during economics class. In which case, feel free to point me out.

I'm not going to give this article more credit than it deserves. At max, it's a shower thought. Am I weird? How long are my showers? 

Still here? Cool, let's get started. 

I'm going to focus on two economic models, ones that have shaped world politics for years. They were behind the cold war. They have both been viewed independently and contradictory by critics: I'm going to talk about the concepts of socialism and capitalism. 

The west has historically championed the latter. And to great success. Free markets have proven to have advantages that one can't expect from other systems. In fact, it has been so successful that historically communist regimes like China have gone forward and adopted very similar economics models. In my opinion, if there is a country that demonstrates the potential of capitalist, business-friendly economic growth models, it wouldn't be the United States, but rather China. (A particular professor of mine would be quite proud right now).

**What definitions of the two terms am I basing all of this on?**

Socialism is a form of governance that, in its most basic way, aims to share a country's economic resources among its citizens who are allocated by a democratically elected government. It differs from communism in that while communism fundamentally allocates resources based on the needs of individuals, socialism allows for rewards based on individual contribution to society. While this can also be seen as a feature of capitalism, a significant difference is that it diminishes class differences.

Capitalism is an economic system that ""capitalizes on human ambition and desire for progress. It supports private enterprise and advocates minimal regulation by the government. Capitalists argue that the overall benefit to an economy is that innovation leads to more efficient production of goods and services, causing a trickle-down effect to the masses who eventually benefit from these new technologies. In their view, the government alone can only take care of so many people by itself. It is better to let the private sector flourish and employ the population. They shall naturally innovate and invest in research to have an advantage over the competition, benefiting society in return.

Now that I'm clear about the definitions, let's move on to another aspect of the discussion.

**Which one's better for the world?**

I'm going to go with the classic MBA answer that professors are tired of hearing from students for desperate CP: It depends.

No shade, no matter how vibrant it can be applied indiscriminately on a canvas without first looking at the color already present in the region you want to paint. Look at what's already present to understand what your solution shall change or improve. 
Am I contradicting myself? Maybe, I am. But this isn't an article for Harvard Business Review. It's a rant. Can't say I didn't warn you. If you're expecting a solution to the world's problems, you need to raise your standards.

Both sides have their pros and cons. A better question would be: 

**Which one is more needed right now?**

The answer might depend on what aspect of development needs to be focused upon in the first place. From the few classes that I do remember, economic progress is dependent on two primary parameters: growth and equality. In simple terms, growth is concerned with the size of the pie and rate at which it grows, equality is about how the pie is cut up and how big a piece does everyone on the table get.

And after a little thought, here's what I've come to while capitalism stands super strong in the former, socialism wins in the latter. 

Don't get me wrong. A pro-business government with poor business policies and which doesn't develop the necessary infrastructure for the industry can spectacularly fail to generate any revenue or jobs for the country. Conversely, a socialist-style government can also become intensely corrupt and indifferent to its citizens' needs and go on to prioritize investment in other areas, such as heavy militarization.

I say that while these forms of governance tend to slip towards the states, as mentioned earlier, inherently, at a conceptual level, these opposing sides possess solutions to the two different aspects of the problem.  

Capitalism focuses on human innovation and ambition, the results of which capitalists believe will result in overall economic growth. Regarding inequality, they argue that this generated wealth shall trickle down to the economically weaker sections. This is supported by the Kuznets' Hypothesis, proposed in the 1950s by economist Simon Kuznets. It shows that while initially, in the beginning, the gap between the rich and poor increases with economic growth, in the long run, this gap decreases due to wealth trickling down to the masses.

Unfortunately, this hypothesis has been disputed in the recent past by economists. The main arguments against this are: the datasets taken by Kuznets are from the 1920s to the late 1940s, a period comprising two World Wars and one global recession; events that shaped the world for generations to come. As a result, it is risky to conclude based on this data, that this shift of wealth is the natural flow of things, and not due to exceptional circumstances. A study analyzing a CEO and workers' wages for the same company over 30 years, revealed that while worker wages increased by 10% or by 1.1 times, the CEO's salary increased by 3000% or 30 times. 

The world's richest 1 percent, those with more than $1 million, owns 44 percent of the world's wealth. Their data shows that adults with less than $10,000 in wealth make up 56.6 percent of the world's population but hold less than 2 percent of global wealth. (Source: Credit Suisse). This further reveals the ever-growing divide between the rich and the poor and the ultra-rich. 

Socialism proposes a worker-based economy, where workers are rightly paid/rewarded based on their contribution to the production of goods and services for the economy. A system like this ensures workers aren't exploited or targeted by more prominent corporations or individuals for the mere purpose of profit. It is based on the belief that humans aren't inherently competitive but instead forced to compete due to external competitive markets and societies. This belief has a glaring flaw. Ambition is a significant part of human personality. It is as ingrained in us as our desire for food, water, and shelter. 

Below is the Maslow's hierarchy of needs triangle, showing from top to bottom which needs come first and which needs to take priority once those are fulfilled. Here's where I find that socialism as an ideology or economic system goes against basic human nature. 



A socialist worker-centric economy should do an excellent job of getting one up the first three levels of the triangle. However, from there on, individuals trying to move to the Esteem phase and beyond shall find themselves held back and even repressed by the system. Granted that one shall not completely be repressed, punished, or locked away for trying, unlike a hard-line communist state, they shall neither be met with too much enthusiasm and encouragement in a socialist economic system.  

Recognition, status, and self-esteem are closely linked with ambition and the desire to move forward and improve on one's current situation (financial, health, relationship-wise). Any system that refuses to accept this, and glosses it over with the concept of equality and uniformity, is ignoring basic human nature. 

Now that we're done with the primary shortcomings of the two, let's answer the question posed by us at the start: what do we require right now?

The current world has gotten too pro-business. Industrialists and lobbyists have gotten too powerful and wield excess power over legislators. This has not come without any adverse outcomes. Labour laws have come under intense scrutiny across countries. Cheap labor in countries like India, China, Bangladesh, etc., has resulted in governments compromising on worker rights, such as minimum wages, workplace safety, employee benefits, etc. 

The trickle-down effect that advocates for capitalism have pushed the world to believe that freer markets and less regulation of private enterprise benefit everyone, which has proven to be very weak, if not non-existent. The economic chaos caused by the coronavirus has torn down the curtain on a system that does too much for elites and not enough for workers. You know it's a faulty system when companies get bailouts worth billions, most of which go to investors and executives rather than workers. While Jeff Bezos continues to get even richer as Amazon stock prices surge, workers in Amazon warehouses continue to die from the virus.
Closer home, while the middle class and the rich quarantine themselves at home, complaining about how they want to go out, migrant laborers walk hundreds of miles back home to their villages after being thrown out of their jobs without any safety nets or prior notice. There's little chance they're going to get these jobs back even once things go back to "normal." 

At a time like this, I firmly believe a system that places workers at the center should be embraced rather than opposed. It's high time that our workers are acknowledged for their efforts and sufferings, not just through speeches, sermons, and writings such as these, but also through policies that at least keep them afloat, if not empowered, during times of crisis. 

And no, I'm not suggesting a return to communism or a state monopoly over the economy that, while being a worker-based economy, becomes a breeding ground to inefficiency, corruption and paves the path to an authoritarian regime. Instead, I propose a system not radically, but the significantly different system from our current one. A system that keeps enough incentives for investment while ensuring that everyone, irrespective of their level of income or economic status, is given a minimum number of opportunities for growth in their life.

How to bring that change? Here's something that I have in mind. There are better ways to incentivize better wages and working conditions for workers in factories and corporations than tax breaks, which cost government coffers crores in taxes. 

One would be to invest in facilities that would help both the industry and the general public. Public infrastructure, for example, is an excellent place to start. The Pradhan Mantri Grameen Sadak Yojana, since its inception in 2000, has delivered where it comes to building metalled, all-weather roads even to the remotest of villages. At present, we have schemes targeting every aspect that I feel are necessary to save our population from a mass unemployment crisis.
MNREGA can be used to keep the rural population engaged in employment while also getting paid. With thousands of migrants coming back from urban centers to their villages in light of the recent lockdown, we will have a large workforce for massive infrastructure projects.

Rural Electrification Programmes can make vast amounts of power available in rural areas eliminating electricity limitations for setting up industry. Simultaneously, we can work on skilling our population by heavily investing in Skill India. And when I say skill, I don't mean a graduate or post-graduate degree. I mean technical, diploma-level training. 

A software engineer or marketing manager might not be needed everywhere. Still, an electrician or a plumber fits in almost anywhere. These jobs are more essential and integral to a workplace than most would care to acknowledge. You think you're essential? Wait till your IT guy at your Internet Service Provider stops his work. Or your local electrician doesn't drop by to fix your AC. If we're going to try and have private enterprises hire our country's workforce, we might as well deliver on quality of labor. I don't think I need to even elaborate on the individual benefits of these initiatives. 

In parallel to these programs, we can draw up worker policies that ensure while workers are tapped to their fullest potential by corporations, they aren't exploited or neglected in any manner by employers.

These policies are all made with the worker in mind, with the general population in mind, all while ensuring that the entrepreneurs and businesses do not end up on the losing side of these. After all, it is they who are responsible for employment and innovation in any society. No solution, no matter how well-intended works in the long run, by alienating or punishing a group of stakeholders. I see socialist values in these steps and hence believe that it's time to move a little to the left. 

For if there is something that this crisis has taught us, it's that when things go south, it's not the middle class or the wealthy elites, who suffer: at worst, they go through mild inconveniences. It's the migrant families who have left their villages for cities in search of employees who bear the brunt of our careless economic policies that have brought them too or have kept them at a point where they are left to fend for themselves.

Perhaps, the world has gone a little too far-right. It's time for little shift to the left. It's time for some focus on the "little" guy. It's time to be a bit considerate. A little humane.

Will we encounter problems in the way? Will we encounter resistance from interest groups bent on pushing their own agenda? Will we find issues in our own solutions as we implement them? Yes, yes, and yes.

But will we silence these critics and dismiss their claims? No. We shall debate and discuss, not with emotions, but with facts, take all with us as we move towards a new path. Am I being a little too optimistic? I'm being hopeful. But then again:
