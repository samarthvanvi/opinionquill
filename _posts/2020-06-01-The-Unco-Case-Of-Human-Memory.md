We all know how messed up the media is. It's very tough to find a news media outlet without biased reports, coverages, and malicious stories. 

In India, there is a national television channel known as "Republic TV." It's co-founded by Mr. Arnab Goswami. Mr. Arnab is a famous journalist, but now he is known as the mouthpiece for India's government. In 2017, he gave a [speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etmpWdv3e6M) about his close encounter to death in the 2002 Gujarat riots. After that speech, a chain of social media posts went trending. It was from Arnab's former colleague at NDTV news channel, Mr. Rajdeep Sardesai, who [rubbished this incident](https://www.indiatoday.in/fyi/story/rajdeep-sardesai-arnab-goswami-gujarat-riots-republic-tv-fake-news-1047991-2017-09-19). Mr. Sardesai basically said that it was him and some other people who were interviewing, and Arnab was not even present with him.
But who do you think is correct?

On 28 January 1986, NASA's space shuttle, Challenger, exploded. It is an incident that is known as the [disaster that changed NASA](https://www.space.com/18084-space-shuttle-challenger.html).  

Now, shifting the focus to Dr. Ulric Neisser, an American-German psychologist, more popularly referred to as 'Father of Cognitive Psychology,' wrote a paper on "Affect and Accuracy in Recall: Studies of 'Flashbulb' Memories" which received great adulation in the world of psychology. 

As a part of his experiment, he asked the undergrad students of Emory University about where the students were when NASA's Challenger disaster happened. Basically, he distributed his questionnaire which contained questions such as "Where were you when the disaster happened?", "By what means did you get to learn about the explosion of the space shuttle," "What were you doing?" and others. He did this just after the day of the disaster. 

One of the students [replied](https://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/idea-happened-memory-recollection), "I'd been in my religion class when I heard some student begin to talk about some explosion. I did not know any details of what happened. After class, I went to my room, where I watched the news on TV, by myself, and learned more about the tragedy."

When Dr. Neisser went to the same students, after two and a half year, the same student wrote the [following](https://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/idea-happened-memory-recollection), "My roommate sat watching television in our Emory University dorm room. A news flash came across the screen, which shocked us both. I was upset. I raced upstairs to tell another friend the news. Then I called my parents."

In the first reply, the student said that she was alone. Whereas in the second reply, she said she was with a friend. So basically, if you observe, the details of the memories that she mentioned at various time instances are not the same. There were many significant responses like the above, which did not have symmetry in the memory that they shared. This led Dr. Ulric Neisser to develop a concept called the "[Flashbulb Memory](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/11/12/1314373110)."

Flashbulb memories are memories about very significant events. Like "Where were you when this happened" "What were you doing," etc. Basically, what Dr. Neisser said was that our flashbulb memories can be utterly wrong. And as an empirical backing, he used the above experiment for his theory on flashbulb memories, which actually brought him into the limelight.

This is quite interesting because a lot of us rely on our memories for a lot of things. Now the logical question is, why does this happen. That is, why are our memories so wrong despite our confidence about them. Regarding the same, Prof. Charles Brainerd, from Cornell University, says that "[_A key rule about memory change over time is what we call fade-to-gist._](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/mental-memory-is-unreliable-and-it-could-be-worse-091313#1)" Simply, he frames this key rule to memory change as "Fade-to-gist." To illustrate, say you attended the India-Pakistan world cup match. You will not remember the score, who won the toss, chose to bat or bowl, etc. However, we will remember if India won or not and if we had fun or not. Basically, we will remember the summary but never the exact details.

More often than not, we think our memories are like tape-recorders. That is, if you see something and you want to reproduce that memory, it will reproduce from 0 to the end. But that just does not happen. This is because we are influenced by a lot of our biases. Therefore, when you delve back into that specific set of memory that you want to reproduce, you will eventually reproduce. Still, recollected memory is significantly influenced by your cognitive biases. Therefore, many cognitive researchers argue that we may source parts of other memories into the particular one that we are trying to recollect. 

To put simply, human brains require context to remember. For example, if you want to remember what birthday cake you ate, 2 years ago, to get to that memory you go towards thinking, "Who did I invite for the birthday? Did they like the birthday party or not? Where did the birthday take place?" and maybe then reach to the part of the memory of what cake you ate. So you need a context to come up with a memory. It is not only you, but every one of us needs context to recall a memory. 

A famous incident with Mitt Romney, who was Barak Obama's US presidential election contender in 2008. He tried to recall his speech while giving a speech. He said that he attended a parade in Michigan, and it turned out the parade actually took place before he was born. Basically, this happens with a lot of public figures and to a lot of us without even noticing.There are some people who have a photographic memory. Moreover, there is also a rare condition known as Highly superior autobiographical memory (HSAM). It is sporadic to find this condition in people. People having HSAM can recall events like what day was it, what whether was it, what were they wearing in extra-ordinary detail. We can also see little kids and even grown-up adults when given a date; they can say what day it was, what they were doing, what did their mom cook, etc.

Now the interesting thing is that there is research that was published in 2013, which says that "[_Individuals with highly superior autobiographical memory (HSAM) are also false._](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/11/12/1314373110)" This may get even [worse](https://911memory.nyu.edu/abstracts/talarico_rubin.pdf). We all know what inception about is. It tried to tell how that it is possible that you can embed ideas in people's minds. This can be done by entering people into peoples' dreams and injecting the idea, which they would feel later that it was them that came up with the ideas themselves. Isn't it scary?

Now, another prolific cognitive memory researcher, Elizabeth Loftus, carried out an [experiment](https://slate.com/technology/2013/09/elizabeth-loftus-interview-false-memory-research-on-eyewitnesses-child-abuse-recovered-memories.html) that gave the empirical backing that it Is possible that we can plant memories and change someone's behavior. 

Now the scary thing about this lousy memory of humans is that we rely on this flashbulb memory for a lot of things. One thing is eyewitnesses. Here is an [example](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/26/opinion/sunday/why-do-innocent-people-confess.html) that startled me.

So, I decided to search upon much of the importance our judicial system gives to eyewitnesses. That shocked me. 
 In the Indian judicial system, there is a significantly big emphasis on eyewitness testimonies. Section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act of 1872 says that there are two forms of witnesses. They are documentary and eyewitnesses. In 2011, the Supreme Court of India [ruled](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/north/story/supreme-court-solitary-witness-convict-testimony-144414-2011-10-30) that courts can rely only on one witness before convicting someone. This is alarming. 


In 2019, over 43 lakh cases are still pending in High Courts alone, and among them, over 8 lakh cases are over a decade old ([Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FojC-evd37Y)). Now imagine, for these decade-old cases, how bad an impact would relying on eyewitnesses would cause. The Netflix series, 'The Innocence Files,' shows the occurrences of innocent people being convicted.
 I also searched about how courts around the world respond to this problem of eyewitnesses. The one major solution for problems like these that developed countries use are the DNA test, and others. Basically, forensic reports and electronic evidence. 

But unfortunately, in India, these resources are very scarce. An example of this is that there are over 12,000 sexual assault cases pending just because there is a dearth in forensic labs ([source](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-12-000-dna-samples-from-sexual-assault-cases-pending-examination-at-forensic-labs/story-AzD26fBHTEibaUu7OKinoN.html)).

As we started with Mr. Arnab Goswami's case of lying, we can safely say that it is hard to conclude that someone is lying because we do not know whose memory is a flashbulb memory. So now, don't only be cautious about fake news, also be careful about the aspect of the accuracy of your memories.
